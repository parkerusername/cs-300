What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Mostly we dealt with the various data structures one can use to store lists of data. It was both an excellent refresher, and in the case of hash tables, as wonderful learning experience, filling out a gap in my knowledge. The issue of how to store data effeciently and sort that data is ongoing, and of great importance. There is no ammount of practice that is too much.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I decided to use a binary search tree for my project, originally I was a little worried when I decided that during project 1. Like, am I just making more work for myself by not using a vector? Of course, then I got to project 2, and actually implemented the code, and just being done after writing everything, not having the write an extra sorting algorithm, it felt quite nice. It only takes five minutes or so to write a selection sort, but that is five minutes I saved.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Not having a testing enviroment set up was a huge challenge. If I could go back, I'd have downloaded some kind of testing framework for C++. I'm not used to writing code that doesn't have tests. It feels like I'm blind and trying to navigate a maze. It worked out, but mostly through grit. Definitly mistake on my part.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I'm probably going to use more complex data strucutre more often! They really do make a lot of things easier don't they? I usually just use either a vector or a dictionary for everything, and honestly that was fine, but now I see it's not ideal. Excellent class, 10/10.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My code is. . . well it's good enough. It's hard to change habits you've had for years over a two month course. That being said, I do believe I've improved a little. It's a slow, and unending process, trying to reach truly elegant and expressive code. I'm not there yet, but I'd like to be one day.
